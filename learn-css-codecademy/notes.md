#### Inline Styles

<p style='color:red;'>I'm learning to code!</p>

<p style='color:blue; font-size:30px;'>I'm learning to code!</p>

> It’s important to know that inline styles are a quick way of directly styling an HTML element, but are rarely used when creating websites. 



#### Internal Stylesheet

HTML allows you to write CSS code in its own dedicated section with a element nested inside of the `<head>` element. The CSS code inside the `<style>` element is often referred to as an *internal stylesheet*.

> An internal stylesheet has certain benefits and use cases over inlines styles, but once again, it’s not best practice. 



To create an internal stylesheet:

```html
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: red;
      font-size: 20px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```



#### External Stylesheet

Developers avoid mixing code by storing HTML and CSS code in separate files (HTML files contain only HTML code, and CSS files contain only CSS code).

You can create an external stylesheet by using the **.css** file name extension, like so: **style.css**

When HTML and CSS codes are in separate files, the files must be linked.

You can use the `<link>` element to link HTML and CSS files together. The `<link>` element must be placed within the head of the HTML file. It is a self-closing tag and requires the following attributes:

1. `href` — like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path, to the CSS file.
2. `rel` — this attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file. Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to `stylesheet`.



```html
<link href='./style.css' rel='stylesheet'>
```
