### Console

The console is a panel that displays important messages, like errors, for developers. Much of the work the computer does with our code is invisible to us by default. If we want to see things appear on our screen, we can print, or *log*, to our console directly.

In JavaScript, the `console` keyword refers to an object, a collection of data and actions, that we can use in our code. Keywords are words that are built into the JavaScript language, so the computer will recognize them and treats them specially.

One action, or method, that is built into the `console` object is the `.log()` method. When we write `console.log()` what we put inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged, to the console.

It’s going to be very useful for us to print values to the console, so we can see the work that we’re doing.

```javascript
console.log(5);
```

This example logs `5` to the console. The semicolon denotes the end of the line, or statement. Although in JavaScript your code will usually run as intended without a semicolon, we recommend learning the habit of ending each statement with a semicolon so you never leave one out in the few instances when they are required.

### Comments

Comments can explain what the code is doing, leave instructions for developers using the code, or add any other useful annotations.

There are two types of code comments in JavaScript:

1. A *single line comment* will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes `//` preceding it.

```javascript
// Prints 5 to the console
console.log(5);
```

You can also use a single line comment to comment after a line of code:

```javascript
console.log(5);  // Prints 5 
```

2. A *multi-line comment* will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with `/*` to begin the comment, and `*/` to end the comment.

```javascript
/*
This is all commented 
console.log(10);
None of this is going to run!
console.log(99);
*/
```

You can also use this syntax to comment something out in the middle of a line of code:

```javascript
console.log(/*IGNORED!*/ 5);  // Still just prints 5 
```

### Data Types

*Data types* are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in programming. In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental data types:

- *Number*: Any number, including numbers with decimals: `4`, `8`, `1516`, `23.42`.
- *String*: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: `' ... '` or double quotes `" ... "`. Though we prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.
- *Boolean*: This data type only has two possible values— either `true` or `false` (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” question.
- *Null*: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword `null` (without quotes).
- *Undefined*: This data type is denoted by the keyword `undefined` (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than `null`.
- *Symbol*: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.
- *Object*: Collections of related data.

The first 6 of those types are considered *primitive data types*. They are the most basic data types in the language. *Objects* are more complex. 

```javascript
console.log('Location of Codecademy headquarters: 575 Broadway, New York City');
console.log(40);
```

In the example above, we first printed a string. Our string isn’t just a single word; it includes both capital and lowercase letters, spaces, and punctuation.

Next, we printed the number 40, notice we did not use quotes.

### Arithmetic Operators

An *operator* is a character that performs a task in our code. JavaScript has several built-in *arithmetic operators*, that allow us to perform mathematical calculations on numbers. These include the following operators and their corresponding symbols:

1. Add: `+`
2. Subtract: `-`
3. Multiply: `*`
4. Divide: `/`
5. Remainder: `%`

The first four work how you might guess:

```javascript
console.log(3 + 4); // Prints 7
console.log(5 - 1); // Prints 4
console.log(4 * 2); // Prints 8
console.log(9 / 3); // Prints 3
```

Note that when we `console.log()` the computer will evaluate the expression inside the parentheses and print that result to the console. If we wanted to print the characters `3 + 4`, we would wrap them in quotes and print them as a string.

```javascript
console.log(11 % 3); // Prints 2
console.log(12 % 3); // Prints 0
```

The remainder operator, sometimes called *modulo*, returns the number that remains after the right-hand number divides into the left-hand number as many times as it evenly can: `11 % 3` equals 2 because 3 fits into 11 three times, leaving 2 as the remainder.

### String Concatenation

Operators aren’t just for numbers! When a `+` operator is used on two strings, it appends the right string to the left string:

```javascript
console.log('hi' + 'ya'); // Prints 'hiya'
console.log('wo' + 'ah'); // Prints 'woah'
console.log('I love to ' + 'code.')
// Prints 'I love to code.'
```

This process of appending one string to another is called *concatenation*

```javascript
console.log('front ' + 'space'); 
// Prints 'front space'
console.log('back' + ' space'); 
// Prints 'back space'
console.log('no' + 'space'); 
// Prints 'nospace'
console.log('middle' + ' ' + 'space'); 
// Prints 'middle space'
```

Just like with regular math, we can combine, or chain, our operations to get a final result:

```javascript
console.log('One' + ', ' + 'two' + ', ' + 'three!'); 
// Prints 'One, two, three!'
```

### Properties

When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type. Every string instance has a property called `length` that stores the number of characters in that string. You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name:

```javascript
console.log('Hello'.length); // Prints 5
```

The `.` is another operator! We call it the *dot operator*.

In the example above, the value saved to the `length` property is retrieved from the instance of the string, `'Hello'`. The program prints `5` to the console, because `Hello` has five characters in it.

### Methods

Remember that methods are actions we can perform. JavaScript provides a number of string methods.

We *call*, or use, these methods by appending an instance with:

- a period (the dot operator)
- the name of the method
- opening and closing parentheses

E.g. `'example string'.methodName()`.

Does that syntax look a little familiar? When we use `console.log()` we’re calling the `.log()` method on the `console` object. Let’s see `console.log()` and some real string methods in action!

```javascript
console.log('hello'.toUpperCase()); // Prints 'HELLO'
console.log('Hey'.startsWith('H')); // Prints true
```

Let’s look at each of the lines above:

- On the first line, the `.toUpperCase()` method is called on the string instance `'hello'`. The result is logged to the console. This method returns a string in all capital letters: `'HELLO'`.
- On the second line, the `.startsWith()` method is called on the string instance `'Hey'`. This method also accepts the character `'H'` as an input, or *argument*, between the parentheses. Since the string `'Hey'` does start with the letter `'H'`, the method returns the boolean `true`.

>  You can find a list of built-in string methods in the [JavaScript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/prototype).

### Built-in Objects

In addition to `console`, there are other [objects built into JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects). Down the line, you’ll build your own objects, but for now these “built-in” objects are full of useful functionality.

For example, if you wanted to perform more complex mathematical operations than arithmetic, JavaScript has the built-in `Math` object.

The great thing about objects is that they have methods! Let’s call the `.random()` method from the built-in `Math` object:

```javascript
console.log(Math.random()); // Prints a random number between 0 and 1
```

This method returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). To generate a random number between 0 and 50, we could multiply this result by 50, like so:

```javascript
Math.random() * 50;
```

The example above will likely evaluate to a decimal. To ensure the answer is a whole number, we can take advantage of another useful `Math` method called `Math.floor()`.

`Math.floor()` takes a decimal number, and rounds down to the nearest whole number. You can use `Math.floor()` to round down a random number like this:

```javascript
Math.floor(Math.random() * 50);
```

In this case:

1. `Math.random` generates a random number between 0 and 1.
2. We then multiply that number by `50`, so now we have a number between 0 and 50.
3. Then, `Math.floor()` rounds the number down to the nearest whole number.

If you wanted to see the number printed to the terminal, you would still need to use a `console.log()` statement:

```javascript
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 50)); // Prints a random whole number between 0 and 50
```
