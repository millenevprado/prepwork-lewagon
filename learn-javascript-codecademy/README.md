### Console

The console is a panel that displays important messages, like errors, for developers. Much of the work the computer does with our code is invisible to us by default. If we want to see things appear on our screen, we can print, or *log*, to our console directly.

In JavaScript, the `console` keyword refers to an object, a collection of data and actions, that we can use in our code. Keywords are words that are built into the JavaScript language, so the computer will recognize them and treats them specially.

One action, or method, that is built into the `console` object is the `.log()` method. When we write `console.log()` what we put inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged, to the console.

It’s going to be very useful for us to print values to the console, so we can see the work that we’re doing.

```javascript
console.log(5);
```

This example logs `5` to the console. The semicolon denotes the end of the line, or statement. Although in JavaScript your code will usually run as intended without a semicolon, we recommend learning the habit of ending each statement with a semicolon so you never leave one out in the few instances when they are required.

### Comments

Comments can explain what the code is doing, leave instructions for developers using the code, or add any other useful annotations.

There are two types of code comments in JavaScript:

1. A *single line comment* will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes `//` preceding it.

```javascript
// Prints 5 to the console
console.log(5);
```

You can also use a single line comment to comment after a line of code:

```javascript
console.log(5);  // Prints 5 
```

2. A *multi-line comment* will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with `/*` to begin the comment, and `*/` to end the comment.

```javascript
/*
This is all commented 
console.log(10);
None of this is going to run!
console.log(99);
*/
```

You can also use this syntax to comment something out in the middle of a line of code:

```javascript
console.log(/*IGNORED!*/ 5);  // Still just prints 5 
```

### Data Types

*Data types* are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in programming. In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental data types:

- *Number*: Any number, including numbers with decimals: `4`, `8`, `1516`, `23.42`.
- *String*: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: `' ... '` or double quotes `" ... "`. Though we prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.
- *Boolean*: This data type only has two possible values— either `true` or `false` (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” question.
- *Null*: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword `null` (without quotes).
- *Undefined*: This data type is denoted by the keyword `undefined` (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than `null`.
- *Symbol*: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.
- *Object*: Collections of related data.

The first 6 of those types are considered *primitive data types*. They are the most basic data types in the language. *Objects* are more complex. 

```javascript
console.log('Location of Codecademy headquarters: 575 Broadway, New York City');
console.log(40);
```

In the example above, we first printed a string. Our string isn’t just a single word; it includes both capital and lowercase letters, spaces, and punctuation.

Next, we printed the number 40, notice we did not use quotes.

### Arithmetic Operators

An *operator* is a character that performs a task in our code. JavaScript has several built-in *arithmetic operators*, that allow us to perform mathematical calculations on numbers. These include the following operators and their corresponding symbols:

1. Add: `+`
2. Subtract: `-`
3. Multiply: `*`
4. Divide: `/`
5. Remainder: `%`

The first four work how you might guess:

```javascript
console.log(3 + 4); // Prints 7
console.log(5 - 1); // Prints 4
console.log(4 * 2); // Prints 8
console.log(9 / 3); // Prints 3
```

Note that when we `console.log()` the computer will evaluate the expression inside the parentheses and print that result to the console. If we wanted to print the characters `3 + 4`, we would wrap them in quotes and print them as a string.

```javascript
console.log(11 % 3); // Prints 2
console.log(12 % 3); // Prints 0
```

The remainder operator, sometimes called *modulo*, returns the number that remains after the right-hand number divides into the left-hand number as many times as it evenly can: `11 % 3` equals 2 because 3 fits into 11 three times, leaving 2 as the remainder.

### String Concatenation

Operators aren’t just for numbers! When a `+` operator is used on two strings, it appends the right string to the left string:

```javascript
console.log('hi' + 'ya'); // Prints 'hiya'
console.log('wo' + 'ah'); // Prints 'woah'
console.log('I love to ' + 'code.')
// Prints 'I love to code.'
```

This process of appending one string to another is called *concatenation*

```javascript
console.log('front ' + 'space'); 
// Prints 'front space'
console.log('back' + ' space'); 
// Prints 'back space'
console.log('no' + 'space'); 
// Prints 'nospace'
console.log('middle' + ' ' + 'space'); 
// Prints 'middle space'
```

Just like with regular math, we can combine, or chain, our operations to get a final result:

```javascript
console.log('One' + ', ' + 'two' + ', ' + 'three!'); 
// Prints 'One, two, three!'
```

### Properties

When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type. Every string instance has a property called `length` that stores the number of characters in that string. You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name:

```javascript
console.log('Hello'.length); // Prints 5
```

The `.` is another operator! We call it the *dot operator*.

In the example above, the value saved to the `length` property is retrieved from the instance of the string, `'Hello'`. The program prints `5` to the console, because `Hello` has five characters in it.

### Methods

Remember that methods are actions we can perform. JavaScript provides a number of string methods.

We *call*, or use, these methods by appending an instance with:

- a period (the dot operator)
- the name of the method
- opening and closing parentheses

E.g. `'example string'.methodName()`.

Does that syntax look a little familiar? When we use `console.log()` we’re calling the `.log()` method on the `console` object. Let’s see `console.log()` and some real string methods in action!

```javascript
console.log('hello'.toUpperCase()); // Prints 'HELLO'
console.log('Hey'.startsWith('H')); // Prints true
```

Let’s look at each of the lines above:

- On the first line, the `.toUpperCase()` method is called on the string instance `'hello'`. The result is logged to the console. This method returns a string in all capital letters: `'HELLO'`.
- On the second line, the `.startsWith()` method is called on the string instance `'Hey'`. This method also accepts the character `'H'` as an input, or *argument*, between the parentheses. Since the string `'Hey'` does start with the letter `'H'`, the method returns the boolean `true`.

>  You can find a list of built-in string methods in the [JavaScript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/prototype).

### Built-in Objects

In addition to `console`, there are other [objects built into JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects). Down the line, you’ll build your own objects, but for now these “built-in” objects are full of useful functionality.

For example, if you wanted to perform more complex mathematical operations than arithmetic, JavaScript has the built-in `Math` object.

The great thing about objects is that they have methods! Let’s call the `.random()` method from the built-in `Math` object:

```javascript
console.log(Math.random()); // Prints a random number between 0 and 1
```

This method returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). To generate a random number between 0 and 50, we could multiply this result by 50, like so:

```javascript
Math.random() * 50;
```

The example above will likely evaluate to a decimal. To ensure the answer is a whole number, we can take advantage of another useful `Math` method called `Math.floor()`.

`Math.floor()` takes a decimal number, and rounds down to the nearest whole number. You can use `Math.floor()` to round down a random number like this:

```javascript
Math.floor(Math.random() * 50);
```

In this case:

1. `Math.random` generates a random number between 0 and 1.
2. We then multiply that number by `50`, so now we have a number between 0 and 50.
3. Then, `Math.floor()` rounds the number down to the nearest whole number.

If you wanted to see the number printed to the terminal, you would still need to use a `console.log()` statement:

```javascript
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 50)); // Prints a random whole number between 0 and 50
```

> To see all of the properties and methods on the `Math` object, take a look at [the documentation here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math).

<h2> <a name = "variables"></a>VARIABLES</h2>

In programming, a *variable* is a container for a value. You can think of variables as little containers for information that live in a computer’s memory. Information stored in variables, such as a username, account number, or even personalized greeting can then be found in memory.

Variables also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves.

In short, variables label and store data in memory. There are only a few things you can do with variables:

1. Create a variable with a descriptive name.
2. Store or update information stored in a variable.
3. Reference or “get” information stored in a variable.

**It is important to distinguish that variables are not values**; they contain values and represent them with a name. Observe the diagram with the colored boxes. Each box represents variables; the values are represented by the content, and the name is represented with the label.

![](images/variables.png)

### Create a Variable: var

There were a lot of changes introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript in 2015. One of the biggest changes was two new keywords, `let` and `const`, to create, or *declare*, variables. Prior to the ES6, programmers could only use the `var` keyword to declare variables.

```javascript
var myName = 'Arya';
console.log(myName);
// Output: Arya
```

Let’s consider the example above:

1. `var`, short for variable, is a JavaScript *keyword* that creates, or *declares*, a new variable.
2. `myName` is the variable’s name. Capitalizing in this way is a standard convention in JavaScript called *camel casing*. In camel casing you group words into one, the first word is lowercase, then every word that follows will have its first letter uppercased. (e.g. camelCaseEverything).
3. `=` is the *assignment operator*. It assigns the value (`'Arya'`) to the variable (`myName`).
4. `'Arya'` is the *value* assigned (`=`) to the variable `myName`. You can also say that the `myName` variable is *initialized* with a value of `'Arya'`.
5. After the variable is declared, the string value `'Arya'` is printed to the console by referencing the variable name: `console.log(myName)`.

There are a few general rules for naming variables:

- Variable names cannot start with numbers.
- Variable names are case sensitive, so `myName` and `myname` would be different variables. It is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
- Variable names cannot be the same as *keywords*. For a comprehensive list of keywords check out [MDN’s keyword documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords).

> Note: In the next exercises, we will learn why ES6’s `let` and `const` are the preferred variable keywords by many programmers. Because there is still a ton of code written prior to ES6, it’s helpful to be familiar with the pre-ES6 `var` keyword.

### Create a Variable: let

The `let` keyword signals that the variable can be reassigned a different value. Take a look at the example:

```javascript
let meal = 'Enchiladas';
console.log(meal); // Output: Enchiladas
meal = 'Burrito';
console.log(meal); // Output: Burrito
```

Another concept that we should be aware of when using `let` (and even `var`) is that we can declare a variable without assigning the variable a value. In such a case, the variable will be automatically initialized with a value of `undefined`:

```javascript
let price;
console.log(price); // Output: undefined
price = 350;
console.log(price); // Output: 350
```

Notice in the example above:

- If we don’t assign a value to a variable declared using the `let` keyword, it automatically has a value of `undefined`.
- We can reassign the value of the variable.

### Create a Variable: const

The `const` keyword was also introduced in ES6, and is short for the word constant. Just like with `var` and `let` you can store any value in a `const` variable. The way you declare a `const` variable and assign a value to it follows the same structure as `let` and `var`. Take a look at the following example:

```javascript
const myName = 'Gilberto';
console.log(myName); // Output: Gilberto
```

However, a `const` variable cannot be reassigned because it is *constant*. If you try to reassign a `const` variable, you’ll get a `TypeError`.

Constant variables *must* be assigned a value when declared. If you try to declare a `const` variable without a value, you’ll get a `SyntaxError`.

If you’re trying to decide between which keyword to use, `let` or `const`, think about whether you’ll need to reassign the variable later on. If you do need to reassign the variable use `let`, otherwise, use `const`.

### Mathematical Assignment Operators

Let’s consider how we can use variables and math operators to calculate new values and assign them to a variable. Check out the example below:

```javascript
let w = 4;
w = w + 1;
 
console.log(w); // Output: 5
```

Another way we could have reassigned `w` after performing some mathematical operation on it is to use built-in *mathematical assignment operators*. We could re-write the code above to be:

```javascript
let w = 4;
w += 1;
 
console.log(w); // Output: 5
```

In the second example, we used the `+=` assignment operator to reassign `w`. We’re performing the mathematical operation of the first operator `+` using the number to the right, then reassigning `w` to the computed value.

We also have access to other mathematical assignment operators: `-=`, `*=`, and `/=` which work in a similar fashion.

```javascript
let x = 20;
x -= 5; // Can be written as x = x - 5
console.log(x); // Output: 15
 
let y = 50;
y *= 2; // Can be written as y = y * 2
console.log(y); // Output: 100
 
let z = 8;
z /= 2; // Can be written as z = z / 2
console.log(z); // Output: 4
```

### The Increment and Decrement Operator

Other mathematical assignment operators include the *increment operator* (`++`) and *decrement operator* (`--`).

The increment operator will increase the value of the variable by 1. The decrement operator will decrease the value of the variable by 1. For example:

```javascript
let a = 10;
a++;
console.log(a); // Output: 11

let b = 20;
b--;
console.log(b); // Output: 19
```

### String Concatenation with Variables

In previous exercises, we assigned strings to variables. Now, let’s go over how to connect, or concatenate, strings in variables.

The `+` operator can be used to combine two string values even if those values are being stored in variables:

```javascript
let myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log('I own a pet ' + myPet + '.'); 
// Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'
```

### String Interpolation

In the ES6 version of JavaScript, we can insert, or *interpolate*, variables into strings using *template literals*. Check out the following example where a template literal is used to log strings together:

```javascript
const myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log(`I own a pet ${myPet}.`);
// Output: I own a pet armadillo.
```

Notice that:

- a template literal is wrapped by backticks `
- Inside the template literal, you’ll see a placeholder, `${myPet}`. The value of `myPet` is inserted into the template literal.
- When we interpolate ``I own a pet ${myPet}.``, the output we print is the string: `'I own a pet armadillo.'`

One of the biggest benefits to using template literals is the readability of the code. Using template literals, you can more easily tell what the new string will be. You also don’t have to worry about escaping double quotes or single quotes.

### typeof operator

While writing code, it can be useful to keep track of the data types of the variables in your program. If you need to check the data type of a variable’s value, you can use the `typeof` operator.

The `typeof` operator checks the value to its right and *returns*, or passes back, a string of the data type.

```javascript
const unknown1 = 'foo';
console.log(typeof unknown1); // Output: string
 
const unknown2 = 10;
console.log(typeof unknown2); // Output: number
 
const unknown3 = true; 
console.log(typeof unknown3); // Output: boolean
```

<h2> <a name = "conditional-statements"></a>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</h2>

In life, we make decisions based on circumstances. Think of an everyday decision as mundane as falling asleep — if we are tired, we go to bed, otherwise, we wake up and start our day.

These if-else decisions can be modeled in code by creating *conditional statements*. A conditional statement checks a specific condition(s) and performs a task based on the condition(s).

### If Statement

We often perform a task based on a condition. For example, if the weather is nice today, then we will go outside. If the alarm clock rings, then we’ll shut it off. If we’re tired, then we’ll go to sleep.

In programming, we can also perform a task based on a condition using an `if` statement:

```javascript
if (true) {
  console.log('This message will print!'); 
}
// Prints: This message will print!
```

Notice in the example above, we have an `if` statement. The `if` statement is composed of:

- The `if` keyword followed by a set of parentheses `()` which is followed by a *code block*, or *block statement*, indicated by a set of curly braces `{}`.
- Inside the parentheses `()`, a condition is provided that evaluates to `true` or `false`.
- If the condition evaluates to `true`, the code inside the curly braces `{}` runs, or *executes*.
- If the condition evaluates to `false`, the block won’t execute.

### If...Else Statements

If we wanted to add some default behavior to the `if` statement, we can add an `else` statement to run a block of code when the condition evaluates to `false`. Take a look at the inclusion of an `else` statement:

``` javascript
if (false) {
  console.log('The code in this block will not run.');
} else {
  console.log('But the code in this block will!');
}
 
// Prints: But the code in this block will!
```

An `else` statement must be paired with an `if` statement, and together they are referred to as an `if...else` statement.

In the example above, the `else` statement:

- Uses the `else` keyword following the code block of an `if` statement.
- Has a code block that is wrapped by a set of curly braces `{}`.
- The code inside the `else` statement code block will execute when the `if` statement’s condition evaluates to `false`.

`if...else` statements allow us to automate solutions to yes-or-no questions, also known as *binary decisions*.

### Comparison Operators

When writing conditional statements, sometimes we need to use different types of operators to compare values. These operators are called *comparison operators*.

Here is a list of some handy comparison operators and their syntax:

- Less than: `<`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`
- Is equal to: `===`
- Is not equal to: `!==`

Comparison operators compare the value on the left with the value on the right. For instance:

```javascript
10 < 12 // Evaluates to true
```

It can be helpful to think of comparison statements as questions. When the answer is “yes”, the statement evaluates to `true`, and when the answer is “no”, the statement evaluates to `false`. The code above would be asking: is 10 less than 12? Yes! So `10 < 12` evaluates to `true`.

We can also use comparison operators on different data types like strings:

```javascript
'apples' === 'oranges' // false
```

In the example above, we’re using the *identity operator* (`===`) to check if the string `'apples'` is the same as the string `'oranges'`. Since the two strings are not the same, the comparison statement evaluates to `false`.

All comparison statements evaluate to either `true` or `false` and are made up of:

- Two values that will be compared.
- An operator that separates the values and compares them accordingly (`>`, `<`, `<=`,`>=`,`===`,`!==`).

### Logical Operators

Working with conditionals means that we will be using booleans, `true` or `false` values. In JavaScript, there are operators that work with boolean values known as *logical operators*. We can use logical operators to add more sophisticated logic to our conditionals. There are three logical operators:

- the *and* operator (`&&`)
- the *or* operator (`||`)
- the *not* operator, otherwise known as the *bang* operator (`!`)

When we use the `&&` operator, we are checking that two things are `true`:

```javascript
if (stopLight === 'green' && pedestrians === 0) {
  console.log('Go!');
} else {
  console.log('Stop');
}
```

When using the `&&` operator, both conditions *must* evaluate to `true` for the entire condition to evaluate to `true` and execute. Otherwise, if either condition is `false`, the `&&` condition will evaluate to `false` and the `else` block will execute.

If we only care about either condition being `true`, we can use the `||` operator:

```javascript
if (day === 'Saturday' || day === 'Sunday') {
  console.log('Enjoy the weekend!');
} else {
  console.log('Do some work.');
}
```

When using the `||` operator, only one of the conditions must evaluate to `true` for the overall statement to evaluate to `true`. In the code example above, if either `day === 'Saturday'` or `day === 'Sunday'` evaluates to `true` the `if`‘s condition will evaluate to `true` and its code block will execute. If the first condition in an `||` statement evaluates to `true`, the second condition won’t even be checked. Only if `day === 'Saturday'` evaluates to `false` will `day === 'Sunday'` be evaluated. The code in the `else` statement above will execute only if both comparisons evaluate to `false`.

The `!` *not operator* reverses, or *negates*, the value of a boolean:

```javascript
let excited = true;
console.log(!excited); // Prints false
 
let sleepy = false;
console.log(!sleepy); // Prints true
```

Essentially, the `!` operator will either take a `true` value and pass back `false`, or it will take a `false` value and pass back `true`.

Logical operators are often used in conditional statements to add another layer of logic to our code.

### Truthy and Falsy

Let’s consider how non-boolean data types, like strings or numbers, are evaluated when checked inside a condition.

Sometimes, you’ll want to check if a variable exists and you won’t necessarily want it to equal a specific value — you’ll only check to see if the variable has been assigned a value.

Here’s an example:

```javascript
let myVariable = 'I Exist!';
 
if (myVariable) {
   console.log(myVariable)
} else {
   console.log('The variable does not exist.')
}
```

The code block in the `if` statement will run because `myVariable` has a *truthy* value; even though the value of `myVariable` is not explicitly the value `true`, when used in a boolean or conditional context, it evaluates to `true` because it has been assigned a non-falsy value.

So which values are *falsy*— or evaluate to `false` when checked as a condition? The list of falsy values includes:

- `0`
- Empty strings like `""` or `''`
- `null` which represent when there is no value at all
- `undefined` which represent when a declared variable lacks a value
- `NaN`, or Not a Number

Here’s an example with numbers:

```javascript
let numberOfApples = 0;
 
if (numberOfApples){
   console.log('Let us eat apples!');
} else {
   console.log('No apples left!');
}
 
// Prints 'No apples left!'
```

The condition evaluates to `false` because the value of the `numberOfApples` is `0`. Since `0` is a falsy value, the code block in the `else` statement will run.

### Truthy and Falsy Assignment

Truthy and falsy evaluations open a world of short-hand possibilities!

Say you have a website and want to take a user’s username to make a personalized greeting. Sometimes, the user does not have an account, making the `username` variable falsy. The code below checks if `username` is defined and assigns a default string if it is not:

```javascript
let defaultName;
if (username) {
  defaultName = username;
} else {
  defaultName = 'Stranger';
}
```

If you combine your knowledge of logical operators you can use a short-hand for the code above. In a boolean condition, JavaScript assigns the truthy value to a variable if you use the `||` operator in your assignment:

```javascript
let defaultName = username || 'Stranger';
```

Because `||` or statements check the left-hand condition first, the variable `defaultName` will be assigned the actual value of `username` if it is truthy, and it will be assigned the value of `'Stranger'` if `username` is falsy. This concept is also referred to as *short-circuit evaluation*.

### Ternary Operator

In the spirit of using short-hand syntax, we can use a *ternary operator* to simplify an `if...else` statement.

Take a look at the `if...else` statement example:

```javascript
let isNightTime = true;
 
if (isNightTime) {
  console.log('Turn on the lights!');
} else {
  console.log('Turn off the lights!');
}
```

We can use a *ternary operator* to perform the same functionality:

```javascript
isNightTime ? console.log('Turn on the lights!') : console.log('Turn off the lights!');
```

In the example above:

- The condition, `isNightTime`, is provided before the `?`.
- Two expressions follow the `?` and are separated by a colon `:`.
- If the condition evaluates to `true`, the first expression executes.
- If the condition evaluates to `false`, the second expression executes.

Like `if...else` statements, ternary operators can be used for conditions which evaluate to `true` or `false`.

### Else If Statements

We can add more conditions to our `if...else` with an `else if` statement. The `else if` statement allows for more than two possible outcomes. You can add as many `else if` statements as you’d like, to make more complex conditionals!

The `else if` statement always comes after the `if` statement and before the `else` statement. The `else if` statement also takes a condition. Let’s take a look at the syntax:

```javascript
let stopLight = 'yellow';
 
if (stopLight === 'red') {
  console.log('Stop!');
} else if (stopLight === 'yellow') {
  console.log('Slow down.');
} else if (stopLight === 'green') {
  console.log('Go!');
} else {
  console.log('Caution, unknown!');
}
```

The `else if` statements allow you to have multiple possible outcomes. `if`/`else if`/`else` statements are read from top to bottom, so the first condition that evaluates to `true` from the top to bottom is the block that gets executed.

In the example above, since `stopLight === 'red'` evaluates to `false` and `stopLight === 'yellow'` evaluates to `true`, the code inside the first `else if` statement is executed. The rest of the conditions are not evaluated. If none of the conditions evaluated to `true`, then the code in the `else` statement would have executed.

### The switch keyword

`else if` statements are a great tool if we need to check multiple conditions. In programming, we often find ourselves needing to check multiple values and handling each of them differently. For example:

```javascript
let groceryItem = 'papaya';
 
if (groceryItem === 'tomato') {
  console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');
} else if (groceryItem === 'papaya'){
  console.log('Papayas are $1.29');
} else {
  console.log('Invalid item');
}
```

In the code above, we have a series of conditions checking for a value that matches a `groceryItem` variable. Our code works fine, but imagine if we needed to check 100 different values! Having to write that many `else if` statements sounds like a pain!

A `switch` statement provides an alternative syntax that is easier to read and write. A `switch` statement looks like this:

```javascript
let groceryItem = 'papaya';
 
switch (groceryItem) {
  case 'tomato':
    console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');
    break;
  case 'lime':
    console.log('Limes are $1.49');
    break;
  case 'papaya':
    console.log('Papayas are $1.29');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Invalid item');
    break;
}
 
// Prints 'Papayas are $1.29'
```

- The `switch` keyword initiates the statement and is followed by `( ... )`, which contains the value that each `case` will compare. In the example, the value or expression of the `switch` statement is `groceryItem`.
- Inside the block, `{ ... }`, there are multiple `case`s. The `case` keyword checks if the expression matches the specified value that comes after it. The value following the first `case` is `'tomato'`. If the value of `groceryItem` equalled `'tomato'`, that `case`‘s `console.log()` would run.
- The value of `groceryItem` is `'papaya'`, so the third `case` runs— `Papayas are $1.29` is logged to the console.
- The `break` keyword tells the computer to exit the block and not execute any more code or check any other cases inside the code block. Note: Without `break` keywords, the first matching case will run, but so will every subsequent case regardless of whether or not it matches—including the default. This behavior is different from `if`/`else` conditional statements that execute only one block of code.
- At the end of each `switch` statement, there is a `default` statement. If none of the `case`s are true, then the code in the `default` statement will run.

<h2> <a name = "functions"></a>FUNCTIONS</h2>

In programming, we often use code to perform a specific task multiple times. Instead of rewriting the same code, we can group a block of code together and associate it with one task, then we can reuse that block of code whenever we need to perform the task again. We achieve this by creating a *function*. A function is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.

### Function Declarations

In JavaScript, there are many ways to create a function. One way to create a function is by using a *function declaration*. Just like how a variable declaration binds a value to a variable name, a function declaration binds a function to a name, or an *identifier*. Take a look at the anatomy of a function declaration below:

![](images/function-declaration.png)

A function declaration consists of:

- The `function` keyword.
- The name of the function, or its identifier, followed by parentheses.
- A function body, or the block of statements required to perform a specific task, enclosed in the function’s curly brackets, `{ }`.

A function declaration is a function that is bound to an identifier, or name.

**We should also be aware of the *hoisting* feature in JavaScript which allows access to function declarations before they’re defined.**

Take a look at example of **hoisting**:

```javascript
greetWorld(); // Output: Hello, World!
 
function greetWorld() {
  console.log('Hello, World!');
}
```

Notice how hoisting allowed `greetWorld()` to be called before the `greetWorld()` function was defined! Since hoisting isn’t considered good practice, we simply want you to be aware of this feature.

> If you want to read more about hoisting, check out [MDN documentation on hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting).

### Calling a Function

As we saw in previous exercises, a function declaration binds a function to an identifier.

However, a function declaration does not ask the code inside the function body to run, it just declares the existence of the function. The code inside a function body runs, or *executes*, only when the function is *called*.

To call a function in your code, you type the function name followed by parentheses.

![](images/function-call.png)

This *function call* executes the function body, or all of the statements between the curly braces in the function declaration.

![](images/function-call-working.png)

We can call the same function as many times as needed.

### Parameters and Arguments

So far, the functions we’ve created execute a task without an input. However, some functions can take inputs and use the inputs to perform a task. When declaring a function, we can specify its *parameters*. Parameters allow functions to accept input(s) and perform a task using the input(s). We use parameters as placeholders for information that will be passed to the function when it is called.

Let’s observe how to specify parameters in our function declaration:

![](images/function-parameters.png)

In the diagram above, `calculateArea()`, computes the area of a rectangle, based on two inputs, `width` and `height`. The parameters are specified between the parenthesis as `width` and `height`, and inside the function body, they act just like regular variables. `width` and `height` act as placeholders for values that will be multiplied together.

When calling a function that has parameters, we specify the values in the parentheses that follow the function name. The values that are passed to the function when it is called are called *arguments*. Arguments can be passed to the function as values or variables.

![](images/function-arguments.png)

In the function call above, the number `10` is passed as the `width` and `6` is passed as `height`. Notice that the order in which arguments are passed and assigned follows the order that the parameters are declared.

![](images/function-initial-values.png)

The variables `rectWidth` and `rectHeight` are initialized with the values for the height and width of a rectangle before being used in the function call.

By using parameters, `calculateArea()` can be reused to compute the area of any rectangle!

### Default Parameters

One of the features added in ES6 is the ability to use *default parameters*. Default parameters allow parameters to have a predetermined value in case there is no argument passed into the function or if the argument is `undefined` when called.

Take a look at the code snippet below that uses a default parameter:

```javascript
function greeting (name = 'stranger') {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}
 
greeting('Nick') // Output: Hello, Nick!
greeting() // Output: Hello, stranger!
```

- In the example above, we used the `=` operator to assign the parameter `name` a default value of `'stranger'`. This is useful to have in case we ever want to include a non-personalized default greeting!
- When the code calls `greeting('Nick')` the value of the argument is passed in and, `'Nick'`, will override the default parameter of `'stranger'` to log `'Hello, Nick!'` to the console.
- When there isn’t an argument passed into `greeting()`, the default value of `'stranger'` is used, and `'Hello, stranger!'` is logged to the console.

By using a default parameter, we account for situations when an argument isn’t passed into a function that is expecting an argument.

### Return

When a function is called, the computer will run through the function’s code and evaluate the result of calling the function. By default that resulting value is `undefined`.

```javascript
function rectangleArea(width, height) {
  let area = width * height;
}
console.log(rectangleArea(5, 7)) // Prints undefined
```

In the code example, we defined our function to calculate the `area` of a `width` and `height` parameter. Then `rectangleArea()` is invoked with the arguments `5` and `7`. But when we went to print the results we got `undefined`. Did we write our function wrong? No! In fact, the function worked fine, and the computer did calculate the area as `35`, but we didn’t capture it. So how can we do that? With the keyword `return`!

![](images/function-return.png)

To pass back information from the function call, we use a return statement. To create a return statement, we use the `return` keyword followed by the value that we wish to return. Like we saw above, if the value is omitted, `undefined` is returned instead.

When a `return` statement is used in a function body, the execution of the function is stopped and the code that follows it will not be executed. Look at the example below:

```javascript
function rectangleArea(width, height) {
  if (width < 0 || height < 0) {
    return 'You need positive integers to calculate area!';
  }
  return width * height;
}
```

If an argument for `width` or `height` is less than `0`, then `rectangleArea()` will return `'You need positive integers to calculate area!'`. The second return statement `width * height` will not run.

The `return` keyword is powerful because it allows functions to produce an output. We can then save the output to a variable for later use.

### Helper Functions

We can also use the return value of a function inside another function. These functions being called within another function are often referred to as *helper functions*. Since each function is carrying out a specific task, it makes our code easier to read and debug if necessary.

If we wanted to define a function that converts the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, we could write two functions like:

```javascript
function multiplyByNineFifths(number) {
  return number * (9/5);
};
 
function getFahrenheit(celsius) {
  return multiplyByNineFifths(celsius) + 32;
};
 
getFahrenheit(15); // Returns 59
```

In the example above:

- `getFahrenheit()` is called and `15` is passed as an argument.
- The code block inside of `getFahrenheit()` calls `multiplyByNineFifths()` and passes `15` as an argument.
- `multiplyByNineFifths()` takes the argument of `15` for the `number` parameter.
- The code block inside of `multiplyByNineFifths()` function multiplies `15` by `(9/5)`, which evaluates to `27`.
- `27` is returned back to the function call in `getFahrenheit()`.
- `getFahrenheit()` continues to execute. It adds `32` to `27`, which evaluates to `59`.
- Finally, `59` is returned back to the function call `getFahrenheit(15)`.

We can use functions to section off small bits of logic or tasks, then use them when we need to. Writing helper functions can help take large and difficult tasks and break them into smaller and more manageable tasks.

### Function Expressions

Another way to define a function is to use a *function expression*. To define a function inside an expression, we can use the `function` keyword. In a function expression, the function name is usually omitted. A function with no name is called an *anonymous function*. A function expression is often stored in a variable in order to refer to it.

Consider the following function expression:

![](images/function-expression.png)

To declare a function expression:

1. Declare a variable to make the variable’s name be the name, or identifier, of your function. Since the release of ES6, it is common practice to use `const` as the keyword to declare the variable.
2. Assign as that variable’s value an anonymous function created by using the `function` keyword followed by a set of parentheses with possible parameters. Then a set of curly braces that contain the function body.

To invoke a function expression, write the name of the variable in which the function is stored followed by parentheses enclosing any arguments being passed into the function.

```javascript
variableName(argument1, argument2)
```

> Unlike function declarations, function expressions are not hoisted so they cannot be called before they are defined.

### Arrow Functions

ES6 introduced *arrow function syntax*, a shorter way to write functions by using the special “fat arrow” `() =>` notation.

Arrow functions remove the need to type out the keyword `function` every time you need to create a function. Instead, you first include the parameters inside the `( )` and then add an arrow `=>` that points to the function body surrounded in `{ }` like this:

```javascript
const rectangleArea = (width, height) => {
  let area = width * height;
  return area;
};
```

### Concise Body Arrow Functions

JavaScript also provides several ways to refactor arrow function syntax. The most condensed form of the function is known as *concise body*. We’ll explore a few of these techniques below:

1. Functions that take only a single parameter do not need that parameter to be enclosed in parentheses. However, if a function takes zero or multiple parameters, parentheses are required.

   ![](images/function-concise-body-arrow-function.png)

2. A function body composed of a single-line block does not need curly braces. Without the curly braces, whatever that line evaluates will be automatically returned. The contents of the block should immediately follow the arrow `=>` and the `return` keyword can be removed. This is referred to as *implicit return*.

   ![](images/function-implicit-return.png)

So if we have a function:

```javascript
const squareNum = (num) => {
  return num * num;
};
```

We can refactor the function to:

```javascript
const squareNum = num => num * num;
```

Notice the following changes:

- The parentheses around `num` have been removed, since it has a single parameter.
- The curly braces `{ }` have been removed since the function consists of a single-line block.
- The `return` keyword has been removed since the function consists of a single-line block.
